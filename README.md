# Python Concepts and Practices

**1. oops.ipynb**
This notebook walks you through the basic concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), including creating a class, inheritance, and polymorphism. It's a quick refresher to help solidify core OOP principles.


**2. oops_banking_challenge.ipynb**
This notebook demonstrates a simple bank deposit and withdrawal program, helping you understand how different methods within a class operate. It also shows how to create and use instances of a class to retrieve and manage account-related information.

**3. exception_handling.ipynb**
When your code runs into an error (exception), you can catch and handle it gracefully using try, except, else, and finally blocks. Good exception handling is a core part of writing robust, reliable Python programs.

**4. python_unit_testing.ipynb**
Unit testing is the practice of testing small, isolated pieces of code (units) to ensure they work correctly. Python includes a built-in framework called unittest for writing and running tests. Use Test-Driven Development (TDD): write tests before code.
